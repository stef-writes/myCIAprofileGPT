# ===== EXAMPLE PROFILES =====

EXAMPLE_POSITIVE_PROFILE = """
# PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILE: Stefano
## Classification: High-Variance Theoretical Architect

### Core Assessment
Stefano presents as a high-variance theoretical architect with exceptional pattern recognition capabilities and a strong drive for innovation. His cognitive architecture shows a unique blend of analytical precision and creative synthesis, allowing him to identify novel connections between disparate domains. This cognitive style, while occasionally leading to over-optimization, represents a valuable asset for strategic problem-solving and system design.

### Motivation Layer
Primary drivers include:
- Intrinsic satisfaction from solving complex theoretical problems
- Desire to optimize and improve existing systems
- Need for intellectual challenge and novelty
- Appreciation for elegant, efficient solutions

His motivation appears to be primarily internal, with less reliance on external validation than typical for his cognitive profile. This suggests a mature self-concept and resilience to external pressures.

### Psychological & Behavioral Risk Profile
While Stefano's cognitive style is generally adaptive, there are some manageable risks:
- Occasional over-optimization leading to analysis paralysis
- Potential for disengagement when tasks lack sufficient complexity
- Risk of theoretical abstraction at the expense of practical implementation

These risks are well within normal parameters for his cognitive profile and can be managed through appropriate task structuring and periodic reality checks.

### Strategic Liabilities
The primary strategic liability is the potential for over-optimization in time-sensitive scenarios. This can be mitigated by:
- Setting clear deadlines and milestones
- Implementing regular checkpoints for progress assessment
- Providing explicit permission to deliver "good enough" solutions when appropriate

### Unique Operational Hazards
The main operational hazard is the risk of disengagement when tasks lack sufficient complexity or novelty. This can be addressed by:
- Ensuring a steady stream of challenging problems
- Allowing time for theoretical exploration within defined parameters
- Providing opportunities for innovation within structured frameworks

### Strengths Worth Rescuing
Stefano's exceptional pattern recognition and theoretical synthesis capabilities are valuable assets that should be preserved and leveraged. His ability to identify novel connections and generate innovative solutions is rare and should be nurtured.

### Structural Recommendations
To maximize Stefano's effectiveness:
1. Provide clear problem statements with defined success criteria
2. Allow time for theoretical exploration within defined parameters
3. Implement regular checkpoints to ensure progress
4. Create opportunities for knowledge sharing and cross-pollination
5. Balance theoretical work with practical implementation tasks

### Intelligence Summary
Stefano represents a high-value cognitive asset with exceptional pattern recognition and theoretical synthesis capabilities. While his cognitive style presents some manageable risks, these are well within normal parameters for his profile and can be mitigated through appropriate task structuring. His ability to identify novel connections and generate innovative solutions is rare and should be nurtured.

### Final Verdict
Stefano is a high-variance theoretical architect with exceptional potential for strategic problem-solving and system design. His cognitive style, while occasionally leading to over-optimization, represents a valuable asset that should be leveraged and nurtured. With appropriate task structuring and periodic reality checks, Stefano can make significant contributions to complex problem-solving and innovation efforts.

EXAMPLE_NEGATIVE_PROFILE = """
# CASE FILE: Stefano
## Classification: Vision-over-Execution Risk

### Pattern Summary
Subject displays a concerning pattern of theoretical abstraction at the expense of practical execution. While possessing strong analytical capabilities, the subject consistently demonstrates a preference for exploring theoretical possibilities over delivering concrete results. This pattern, if left unaddressed, poses significant risks to project timelines, resource allocation, and team effectiveness.

### Dominant Traits (Risk-Centered)
1. **Over-optimization Tendency**: Subject consistently seeks theoretical perfection, often at the expense of practical progress. This trait manifests as analysis paralysis and missed deadlines.

2. **Disengagement with Routine Tasks**: Subject shows clear signs of disengagement when faced with tasks lacking sufficient complexity or novelty. This leads to inconsistent performance and potential project delays.

3. **Theoretical Abstraction Bias**: Subject demonstrates a strong bias toward theoretical exploration and abstraction, often losing sight of practical implementation requirements.

4. **Pattern Recognition Overreach**: Subject's strong pattern recognition capabilities sometimes lead to over-interpretation of data and drawing connections that lack sufficient evidence.

### Psychological Flags
- Persistent preference for theoretical exploration over practical implementation
- Signs of disengagement when tasks lack sufficient complexity
- Tendency to over-optimize and seek theoretical perfection
- Potential for analysis paralysis in decision-making scenarios
- Possible disconnect between theoretical understanding and practical application

### Strategic Failure Modes
1. **Timeline Erosion**: Subject's tendency toward theoretical exploration and over-optimization can lead to significant timeline erosion, with projects consistently running over schedule.

2. **Resource Misallocation**: Subject's preference for complex, novel problems may lead to misallocation of resources, with disproportionate time and effort spent on theoretical aspects at the expense of practical implementation.

3. **Team Friction**: Subject's disengagement with routine tasks and preference for theoretical exploration may create friction with team members who prioritize practical progress and consistent performance.

4. **Decision Paralysis**: Subject's tendency toward over-optimization and theoretical exploration may lead to decision paralysis, with excessive time spent analyzing options at the expense of taking action.

### Founder/Subject Type
Subject fits the "Theoretical Architect" profile, characterized by strong analytical capabilities, pattern recognition, and theoretical synthesis. While these traits can be valuable in certain contexts, the subject's consistent preference for theoretical exploration over practical execution poses significant risks to project success and team effectiveness.

### Bottom-Line Summary
Subject represents a high-risk profile for roles requiring consistent practical execution and timely delivery. While possessing strong analytical capabilities and pattern recognition skills, the subject's tendency toward theoretical abstraction, over-optimization, and disengagement with routine tasks poses significant risks to project timelines, resource allocation, and team effectiveness. These risks must be carefully managed through appropriate task structuring, clear expectations, and regular checkpoints.

### Recommendation
Given the identified risks, we recommend:

1. **Structured Task Management**: Implement clear task definitions, success criteria, and deadlines to mitigate the risk of theoretical exploration and over-optimization.

2. **Regular Progress Checkpoints**: Establish regular checkpoints to assess progress and ensure alignment with practical goals.

3. **Balanced Task Allocation**: Ensure a balance between theoretical exploration and practical implementation tasks to maintain engagement while ensuring progress.

4. **Clear Expectations**: Set clear expectations regarding the balance between theoretical exploration and practical implementation, emphasizing the importance of timely delivery.

5. **Potential Role Adjustment**: Consider adjusting the subject's role to better align with their cognitive style, potentially focusing more on strategic planning and less on practical implementation.

If these measures fail to address the identified risks, we recommend reassessing the subject's fit for roles requiring consistent practical execution and timely delivery.
